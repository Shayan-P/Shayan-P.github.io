Perhaps we could understand a person very well by just observing all their interactions with others.\nI always had this dream of cloning myself by just feeding all my diaries into a model. Perhaps just having the diaries is not enough but what if we store literally everything. Perhaps smart glasses might be the first step in achieving this. What if we could record all of our interactions with this.\nWe cannot train a seperate model for each person, but if we have a Human Foundation Model we could potentially understand a person using a multi modal data with few shot learning.\nThis seems scary but having a vector embedding that describes a person seems to be a very useful feature that can get applied to many areas.
